This package runs a GUI that enables users to visualise the results of running various common computer vision processes, such as colour segmentation, edge detection, smoothing/blurring and DoG operations.

Two versions exist, one for running on Ubuntu 16.04 (main-gui-ubuntu-16) and the other for Ubuntu running on Ubuntu 18.04 (main-gui-ubuntu-18).

Alternatively, it includes a python script titled cv_functions.py that makes it somewhat easier to view how to operate some of the basic OpenCV functions.

This package runs a GUI that enables users to visualise the results of running various common computer vision processes, such as colour segmentation, edge detection and smoothing/blurring operations.

Alternatively, it includes a python script titled cv_functions.py that makes it somewhat easier to view how to operate some of the basic OpenCV functions.

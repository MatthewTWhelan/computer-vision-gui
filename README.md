This package runs a GUI that enables users to visualise the results of running various common computer vision processes, such as colour segmentation, edge detection, smoothing/blurring and DoG operations.

This was used as a teaching aid for first year computer science students in order to help them understand basic computer vision operations.

The Ubuntu 18.04/16.04 executable is called "main-gui" and located in the main directory, whilst the Windows-OS executable is found in the directory dist-windows and simply called "gui".

Alternatively, it includes a python script titled cv_functions.py that makes it somewhat easier to view how to operate some of the basic OpenCV functions. 

The main script for the GUI is found in gui.py, and is built using the Tkinter package.
